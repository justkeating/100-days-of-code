### Day 2: Dec 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Setup python environment using pyenv. Started buidling a portfolio using Django.
**Thoughts:** Difficult to decide what project to start with that can be beneficial. Chose this portofolio app after googling as it can use some backend and build an end to end app so I become full stack. Setup folder structure, routes, and able to get a page up and running on a server. Looking to add more in and involve pickleball or some sort of data analytics involving pickleball or something of interest.

### Day 3: Dec 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Continued Django tutorial to build portfolio app.

**Thoughts:** Added bootstrap and intial structure to backend for Django. Adding the views, understanding the routes, templates to be inherited, linking different folders that can make creating content more organized. Had to to do some debugging. Paths were not correct from tutorial and local. have a local server up and running and able to display home page with bootstrap, and projects page setting up a sql lite db.
