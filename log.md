**Today's Progress**: Setup python environment using pyenv. Started buidling a portfolio using Django.
**Thoughts:** Difficult to decide what project to start with that can be beneficial.

Setup folder structure, routes, and able to get a page up and running on a server. Looking to add more in and involve pickleball or some sort of data analytics involving pickleball or something of interest.
