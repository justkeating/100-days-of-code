# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Read/write csv in python. manipulate/clean data to remove special chars. need to fix github keys to push to repo

**Thoughts:** Started with Reading/writing csv files with pyhthon using the paddle spreadsheet from john kew. Just broke down the paddles by price into 3 spread sheets. figuring the github keys to push to repo but was able to do some manipluation of data and some data cleaning bc of the $ sign in price.
